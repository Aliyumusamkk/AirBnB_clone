AirBnB Clone - The Console

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.

This stage will have a command-line interface for data management, manipulation and storage. You will be able to Create, Read, Update and Destroy objects.

The system used is JSON serialization and deserialization.

How to use the console:

./console.py - Will run the console.

(hbnb) quit - Will quit the console.

(hbnb) create - Will create an object

(hbnb) help - Will display help for any input command

(hbnb) show / (hbnb) .show() - Will show an object

(hbnb) destroy / (hbnb) .destroy() - Will destroy an object

(hbnb) all / (hbnb) all - Will show all objects or all instances of a class

(hbnb) update "" - Will Update an attribute of an object.
